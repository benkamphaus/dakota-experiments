# Dakota: HydroTrend Experiment 2

* Multidim N x N
* Temperature and precipitation
* Use WMT default values as start point; increment _(What happens if the temperature increases by 10 percent? By 20 percent?)_
* Python wrappers to prep, call, and process HydroTrend output
* Use two response functions: one for mean Qs, the other for std deviation.

## Notes

* The Python script must be executable.
* The minimum `P` value must be above the `baseflow` value.
